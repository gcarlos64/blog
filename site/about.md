title: About me
...

I'm a undergraduate computer science student and Free Software
activist. Here is the place where I'll post everything that I want to
share about some cool things I have been doing :)

I'm interested in almost everything in computer science and engineering,
but more specifically in system programming, system administration and digital
electronics (not that I'm that good in any of these, I'm just a lifelong
learner).

I worked a while as system administrator but now I'm being mentored
at the [Xorg EVoC](https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgEVoC/) program
(thankfully by my mentors [André Almeida](https://andrealmeid.com),
[Maíra Canal](https://mairacanal.github.io/) and [Tales
Aparecida](https://tales-aparecida.github.io/tales-tips-and-tricks/),
where I will be contributing to the Linux DRM subsystem writing unit tests.

If you want to, feel free to [contact me](/contact.html).
