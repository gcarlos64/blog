title: About me
...

I'm a undergraduate computer science student and Free Software
enthusiast. Here is the place where I'll post everything that I want to
share about some cool things I have been doing :)

I'm interested in almost everything in computer science and engineering,
but more specifically in system programming, system administration and digital
electronics (not that I'm that good in any of these, I'm just a lifelong
learner).

If you want to, feel free to [contact me](/contact.html).

You can download my CV [here](/cv.pdf).
